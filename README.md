=================

Here is a complete solution for the Synacor Challenge as detailed at https://challenge.synacor.com/

From the challenge spec:
In this challenge, your job is to use this architecture spec to create a
virtual machine capable of running the included binary.  Along the way,
you will find codes; submit these to the challenge website to track
your progress.  Good luck!

It's in Clojure because I wanted to see if I could.
